# Movie Application Project

A simple movie application that fetches data from an API to display information about various films. This project involves implementing features such as searching for movies, displaying details like title, synopsis, and ratings, and possibly adding functionalities like favorites or watchlists.

Through this project, I'm further enhancing my skills in handling APIs, managing state, and building a responsive user interface. It's a great way to apply what I've learned in previous projects, like handling asynchronous operations, and to continue growing my expertise in React development.
